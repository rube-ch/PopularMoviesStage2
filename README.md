# Popular Movies Stage 2
This is the FINAL stage of the final project "Popular Movies" of the Udacity course "Developing Android Apps"

To fetch popular movies, you will use the API from themoviedb.org.

If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key.

In your request for a key, state that your usage will be for educational/non-commercial use. You will also need to provide some personal information to complete the request. Once you submit your request, you should receive your key via email shortly after.

Once you have your API Key include it for the build by adding the following line to [PROJECT_HOME]/gradle.properties

MyMoviewDBApiKey = "<UNIQUE_API_KEY">
